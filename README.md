# React Personal Business Card

This project was completed as a solo project for Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path Curriculum. The project uses React to generate a personal business card with links to social media websites and email. I used Vite to create it locally rather than creating it on Scrimba. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
